# Steganography-Demonstration

# Objective

The Steganography Demonstration project aims to provide an understanding of steganography concepts, its benefits, and practical implementation through a hands-on example. Specifically, the project demonstrates how to perform image steganography by hiding text within an image using tools like Stegosuite or other preinstalled options available in Kali Linux.

# Skills Learned

- Understanding of steganography concepts and its significance in information security.
- Proficiency in using steganography tools for hiding information within digital media.
- Ability to analyze and interpret steganographic content.
- Application of steganography techniques in real-world scenarios.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in information security.

# Tools Used

- Stegosuite or other steganography tools for hiding text within images.
- Image editing software for manipulating digital images.
- Kali Linux or similar operating system with preinstalled steganography tools.

# Steps

## Step 1: Initial Setup and Installation of Tools

This screenshot demonstrates the initial setup and installation of Stegosuite or other steganography tools on the operating system (e.g., Kali Linux). It showcases the installation process and verifies successful installation.

## Step 2: Selection of Cover Image

In this step, a cover image is selected for the steganographic process. The image should be chosen carefully to ensure that it can effectively conceal the hidden information without arousing suspicion.

## Step: Inputting Secret Message

The secret message to be hidden within the cover image is inputted into the steganography tool. This message can be any text-based information that the user wishes to conceal.

## Step: Embedding Process

This screenshot illustrates the embedding process, where the steganography tool embeds the secret message within the cover image. The tool adjusts the image's pixels to hide the text while maintaining the image's visual integrity.

## Step 5: Resulting Steganographic Image

After the embedding process is complete, the resulting steganographic image is generated. This image appears identical to the original cover image but contains the hidden text within its pixels.

## Step 6: Extraction of Hidden Message

In this step, the hidden message is extracted from the steganographic image using the same steganography tool. The tool analyzes the image's pixels to retrieve the concealed text.

## Step 7: Verification of Extracted Message

The extracted message is verified to ensure its accuracy and integrity. This step confirms that the steganographic process was successful in hiding and retrieving the text without any loss or alteration.
