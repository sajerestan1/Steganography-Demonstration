# Objective
The Steganography Demonstration project aims to provide an understanding of steganography concepts, its benefits, and practical implementation through a hands-on example. Specifically, the project demonstrates how to perform image steganography by hiding text within an image using tools like Stegosuite or other preinstalled options available in Kali Linux.

# Skills Learned

- Understanding of steganography concepts and its significance in information security.
- Proficiency in using steganography tools for hiding information within digital media.
- Ability to analyze and interpret steganographic content.
- Application of steganography techniques in real-world scenarios.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in information security.

# Tools Used

- Stegosuite or other steganography tools for hiding text within images.
- Image editing software for manipulating digital images.
- Kali Linux or similar operating system with preinstalled steganography tools.

# Steps

## Step 1: Initial Setup and Installation of Tools

This screenshot demonstrates the initial setup and installation of Stegosuite or other steganography tools on the operating system (e.g., Kali Linux). It showcases the installation process and verifies successful installation.
This task makes use of  Stegosuite in Kali Linux
### Install Stegosuite

### Troubleshooting
If the installation encounters interruption, use:
sudo dpkg  –configure -a
This is a breakdown of the command "sudo dpkg --configure -a:
1. sudo:
Grants temporary administrative privileges to the executing user.
Necessary for tasks requiring system-wide modifications, such as package management.
Prompts for the user's password to confirm authorization.
2. dpkg:
The Debian package manager is responsible for installing, removing, and managing software packages on Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu).
3. --configure:
Instructs dpkg to configure packages.
It can be used with specific package names or with '-a' to configure all unpacked but unconfigured packages.
4. -a:
Short for "--pending", targets all packages that have been unpacked but not fully configured.
Often used to resolve issues caused by interrupted installations or configurations.
Putting it all together:
The command "sudo dpkg --configure -a" attempts to configure all unpacked but unconfigured packages on the system.

Allow the command to run and follow the instructions, it might take some time.
Open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get install stegosuite

### Launch Stegosuite:

Navigate to Applications > Kali Linux > Steganography > Stegosuite

## Step 2: Selection of Cover Image

In this step, a cover image is selected for the steganographic process. The image should be chosen carefully to ensure that it can effectively conceal the hidden information without arousing suspicion.

## Step 3: Inputting Secret Message and Embed Text in an Image

The secret message to be hidden within the cover image is inputted into the steganography tool. This message can be any text-based information that the user wishes to conceal.

Click "File" > "Open" and select the image you want to use as the carrier.
Click "Embed" > "Text".
Enter the secret message you want to hide.
Optionally, set a password for added security.
Click "Embed" to initiate the process.
Save the modified image with a new filename.

## Step 4: Resulting Steganographic Image

After the embedding process is complete, the resulting steganographic image is generated. This image appears identical to the original cover image but contains the hidden text within its pixels.

## Step 5: Extraction of Hidden Message

In this step, the hidden message is extracted from the steganographic image using the same steganography tool. The tool analyzes the image's pixels to retrieve the concealed text.

○	Open the steganographic image in Stegosuite.
○	Click "Extract" > "Text".
○	Enter the password (if used during embedding).
○	The hidden message will be displayed.


## Step 6: Verification of Extracted Message

The extracted message is verified to ensure its accuracy and integrity. This step confirms that the steganographic process was successful in hiding and retrieving the text without any loss or alteration.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Steganography Demonstration project provides a comprehensive overview of steganography concepts and practical implementation through a step-by-step example. By following these instructions, users can understand the process of hiding text within images using steganography tools, thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills in information security.
